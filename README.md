##Budget App

This is a simple budgeting application written in Java that allows users to track their income and expenses, set financial goals, and generate reports on their spending patterns.
How to use

    Download the BudgetApp.java file and run it on your Java development environment.
    The program will prompt you to enter your monthly income and expenses for categories such as housing, transportation, food, and entertainment.
    The program will then calculate the remaining income for savings and store all the values in a hashmap.
    The program will then print out a budget summary, showing the dollar amount for each category and the percentage of income spent on each category.
    You can use this information to track your spending and make adjustments to your budget as needed.

Requirements

    Java Development Kit (JDK)
    Java runtime environment (JRE)

Notes

    This application does not use any external libraries such as JFreeChart to generate charts, the output is presented in a simple text format. (Yet ;) )
    This application is a command line based application, the UI is not implemented
    This application is a simple example of how you can use java to create a budgeting application, it may not have all the features and functionality of a complete application
